## Stack

### Basics

  * A stack is a container object that holds values according to the first in last out principle.
  * Only two operations are allowed: **push** the item onto the stack and **pop** the item off the stack.
  * It's like  a stack of books where you can only take one book at a time, and you must always take the top books first.  
  * A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only one at a time. Limited access data structures are a type of sequential data structure, where accessing an element requires passing through each previous data structure. This contrasts with random access data structures, where accessing an element does not depend on checking previous elements. 
  * Stacks are useful for backtracking - a process where a series of operations are performed in reverse order.
  * They're also useful for reversing the order of sequentially structured data.
  * All stack operations must be performed in constant time O(1).


### Study Questions 
1. Define what is a stack.
2. What are the basic operations performed on a stack.
3. What's the difference between a random access vs. sequential access data structure? Which category do stacks fall into and why? 
4. What types of tasks are stacks useful for?
5. What is the time complexity that all stack operations must be limited to?
