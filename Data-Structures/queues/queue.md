## Queue

### Basics

  * Queues are like stacks except open at both ends.
  * Queues adhere to the first in first out architecture, e.g. lunch lines, trains traveling across a bridge.
  *  Main Functions:
  		* enqueue(): add an item to the queue
  		* dequeue(): removed an item from the queue

  * Helper Functions:
      * peak(): returns a copy of the value stored at front of the queue
      * isFull()
      * isEmpty()
