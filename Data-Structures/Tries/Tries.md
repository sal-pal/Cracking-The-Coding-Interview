# Tries

## Basics
1. A trie is a special kind of tree where each vertex represents a single word or a prefix.
2. Tries are useful for finding a word in a collection of words when using only the prefix of that word as input.
3. Each first generation tree represents a group of words, where all words within a group start with the same letter.
4. Tries are useful when needing to find the whole when only given its parts. Two concrete examples of these types of problems are: a) autocompletion for text messaging apps; b) when bioinformaticians need to find a gene's nucleotide sequence when given only a fraction of that sequence.

## Study Questions
1. What are the basic characteristics of tries? Explain the essence of tries as though you were explaining it to your mother.
2. What kinds of problems are tries good at solving? Provide two concrete examples.
